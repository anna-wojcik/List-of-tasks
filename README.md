Newly added tasks are listed. If any task has been done, you can uncheck it by clicking on the green square. However, if you do not want the task to be on the list, you can delete it by clicking on the red square. Over the list of tasks there are two more buttons. The first of them is to hide completed tasks and to show them again. The second button makes all tasks completed.
